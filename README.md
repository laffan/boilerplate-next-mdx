# Next Boilerplate (MDX)

Bare-bones next.js boilerplate with blog (MDX), R3Fiber and scss set up.

Exports to gh-pages branch via this guide : https://www.bravolt.com/post/deploying-next-js-to-github-pages


## Deployment
Uses [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) to serve MDX files via `getStaticProps` 

Should work out of the box, so long as you have a `gh-pages` branch set up.
